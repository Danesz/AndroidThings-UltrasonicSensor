Android Things Basics: Measure distance with Ultrasonic sensor

---

In this Android Things project we will use an Ultrasonic sensor with a Raspberry Pi 3 to measure distance.
We will work with the standard GPIO read and write methods, we will learn how to send ultrasonic waves with the sensor, and we will discover some issues.


---

Requirements
We use a Raspberry Pi 3 with pre-installed Android Things Developer Preview(version 1).
The sensor is an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
